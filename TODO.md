# Tasks
* Try to put the minimap in the room-partial, below the map controls, instead of the aside
* Try to position the room controls in a way that represents the direction they point at (maybe even add arrows?)
* Allow moving through the maze with keyboard arrows
* Maybe allow closing the minimap?
* Full and partial room version
* Actually exiting the maze
* Showing whether it's an entrance in the room
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
