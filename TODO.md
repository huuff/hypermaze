# Tasks
* Add an ending (win) page
* Add a text to indicate to the user they can move with arrow keys. (Maybe on a hover on an info icon? it's a nice opportunity to bring a hover hyperscript behavior)
* Rename the project to hypermaze
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
