# Tasks
* Actually exiting the maze
* Showing whether it's an entrance in the room
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
