# Tasks
* Add a favicon?
* Caching headers in responses
* Preload with HTMX or hyperscript
* Actually exiting the maze
* Showing whether it's an entrance in the room
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
* I'd love to push urls to the history when using `htmx.ajax`, especially for navigating the maze (in `room-view`, for example) but I haven't found how to. Adding an `hx-push-url` to the parent does not work
