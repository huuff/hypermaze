# Tasks
* A legend or something that indicates that the entrance is an `a`, the exit an `e` and you are an `@`??
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
