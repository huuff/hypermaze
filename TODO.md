# Tasks
* Add an ending (win) page
* Add a text to indicate to the user they can move with arrow keys
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
