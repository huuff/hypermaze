# Tasks
* Add a favicon?
* Merge the maze-list and index
* Caching headers in responses
* Preload with HTMX or hypescript
* Allow moving through the maze with keyboard arrows. UPDATE: I've made some progress on this but haven't finished it yet, check the `on keyup` event handler for the `room-partial`
* Actually exiting the maze
* Showing whether it's an entrance in the room
* Implement JSON+HAL
* Implement Maze+XML
* It'd be great if I were able to have a base template for pages (not requested with htmx) instead of copy-pasting most of the template like I do for `index`, `room` and `maze`
